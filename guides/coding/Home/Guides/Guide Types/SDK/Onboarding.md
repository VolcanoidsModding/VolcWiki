:::warning
From now on I will assume you have followed the [Getting Started](/coding/guides/gettingStarted) Guide set and are ready to mod the game using the SDK version of the documentation. If you do not want to use the SDK refer to the [Non-SDK](/coding/nonSdk) guide set.

:::tip
All the data in this section is using the SDK, anything that refers to the VolcanoidsSDK namespace comes from the SDK package. Make sure you have it installed!

Ok I'm putting this here just because I am laughing really hard at this. I have no idea what I was gonna put in this document so for now here's a link to the SDK documentation. The SDK package website and those 2 things above this. Honestly if you have those 2 done you can ignore this.
