:::warning
This is very uncharted territory. If you have no idea what you are doing modding a Unity Game **TURN BACK NOW** Go to the SDK docs and do **NOT** use these. I'm not putting anything else in this document other than this. It's a dangerous road down these next documents. There will be a lot of unfinished documents. And honestly it will look like the developer version of the documentation because it is. I'm just going to update these docs whenever I add to them, not when their done. Our Discord will have updates on this set of docs when I update them. For now however don't expect anything fancy. I don't even think there are docs yet. Who knows, it's the dev version.
