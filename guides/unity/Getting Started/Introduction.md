## A Note from the Volcanoids Developers

### Welcome to the Volcanoids Modding Wiki!

These Guides were put together by the joint effort of MelodicAlbuild (Alex), and Lord Gregory (Greg). Through their efforts
this wiki was both compiled and guides were written up for the complex task that is modding Volcanoids! Now without further
ado lets have our modding experts take over and give you all these amazing guides!

## The Beginning

Alright everyone! If your following these guides it means your interested in changing or "Mod"ifying the Volcanoids Game,
To cover this we have divided up the Volcanoids Modding Guides into a few sections. Our Design Tutorials have become a 
collection of tools and resources by our very own RedDolphin, We're very glad he has these tools available for you all.
Other than that we have our Unity tutorials. Across the Unity tutorials we will cover a lot of things from creating items
to writing a whole new system of materials, and redesigning the questing system. My one request from you all though is 
some patience with me. I have to write and create all of these mods and then the guides for them so not everything will
be available immediately. I promise I'm trying to get them all done as fast as possible though!

:::tip
Official Support for this wiki will be given in the [Volcanoids Discord](https://discord.gg/volcanoids), Ask there if you have any questions.

## Formatting

Now for those of you who need to see things visually don't worry, I got you covered. I will be making a full video course going through the same guide system that these written ones will. Also note that at the end of every guide there will be a GitHub link that will direct you at that guides code and assets, Video guide formats will be discussed in episode 1 of the series. I will update [The Unity Homepage](/unity/) with the link for the playlist of episodes.
