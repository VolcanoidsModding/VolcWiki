Official modding support is planned, including Steam Workshop and tools for authoring content.
This guide show how it's possible to mod Volcanoids even before official support is there.

Mods created according this guide will be compatible when official modding support arrives, but:
- They'll have to be repackaged for uploading to Workshop
- Some game features will change and mods utilizing these features will need updates

Features under active development:
- Combat, Weapons, Enemies, Enemy AI
