## A Note from the Volcanoids Developers
Welcome to the Volcanoids Modding Wiki | Coding Guides!

These Guides were put together by the joint effort of MelodicAlbuild (Alex), and Lord Gregory (Greg). Through their efforts
this wiki was both compiled and guides were written up for the complex task that is modding Volcanoids! Now without further
ado lets have our modding experts take over and give you all these amazing guides!

## The Beginning
Alright everyone! If your following these guides it means your interested in changing or "Mod"ifying the Volcanoids Game,
To cover this we have divided up the Volcanoids Modding Guides into a few sections. If your here you have probably already
noticed the split between coding and designing for the wiki. This is for 2 reasons, 1. Coding the game will have some
different pre-requisites for using the guides, and of course, the coding portion *at least parts of it* are required for
the designing side of things. Now to do a speedy explanation of the format as to not bore you all to death. 

## Formatting
As you might have noticed there are 2 more categories in the Guides category. `Simple Modding` and `Advanced Modding`
