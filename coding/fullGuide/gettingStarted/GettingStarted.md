## The Setup
Beginning with Modding is a step that you can not just skip. These next 2 documents you **MUST** follow or you won't be able to do any of the other guides.

## The Project
Assuming that you have installed Visual Studio like asked to in the previous part of the guide, now we will create the actual project that will be used in the rest of your modding. Open up Visual Studio and hit create new project. Your looking for Class Library for the .NET Framework. Hit next and name it whatever you want. At the bottom however you need to make sure the framework is `.NET Framework 4.7.2`. This part is very important, using another version may break things in the rest of the guide and Volcanoids in general so make sure it's the correct version. You should be greeted with an IDE Screen, unless it's your first time loading it up, in which case you'll have some onboarding to do, just follow the steps and it'll bring you in. 

Okay! Now that you have a project we need to find a folder. Open up your file explorer and find `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` or if you download your games to a custom folder go to that folder, This is only the default location. Find the `steamapps/Volcanoids` folder. And make a note of this location, you'll need it a lot. Next up on the location list is `C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/AppData/LocalLow/Volcanoid/Volcanoids`
