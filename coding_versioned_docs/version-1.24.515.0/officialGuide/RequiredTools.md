Tools
- Volcanoids

- Unity 2020.1.5f1 (optional)
- ILSpy (optional)

You can use any developer environment, but I'll be describing how things are done in VS2019. When installing Visual Studio, make sure to install C# and .NET Framework. Unity is needed for converting debugging symbols from PDB to MDB. If you won't be attaching debugger, you don't need that. ILSpy or other decompiler is very useful tool, you'll be using it to dig into game DLLs and look for classes and their members.

Suggested workloads when installing Visual Studio 2019, Game Development with Unity is required for debugging.
